## NODE REACT MONGO SOCKET DEMO

This is a demo of an online tutorial I followed to further my understanding od Node and React.
http://sahatyalkabov.com/create-a-character-voting-app-using-react-nodejs-mongodb-and-socketio/ 
Most of it code was given to you, just needed to put it in the right place.   Useful exercise, 
introduces many new technologies and explains pretty well how React updates the DOM through EventStores
and Actions.

"In this tutorial we are going to build a character voting app (inspired by Facemash and Hot or Not)
for EVE Online - a massively multiplayer online game"
